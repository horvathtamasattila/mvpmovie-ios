# MVP Movie

- I used xcodegen to generate the project file, it is not required to run the project, just to explain the .yml files. 
- Dependencies are handled with SPM, after checkout the project should build (sometimes it's required to run `File/Packages/Resolve package versions` to properly download dependencies)
